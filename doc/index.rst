PSX Framework
=============

PSX is a framework written in PHP dedicated to build RESTful APIs. It is based
on multiple components which cover many aspects of the API lifecycle. These
components are independent of the framework and can also be used in another
context. More informations at http://phpsx.org

This manual is seperated into three chapters. The :doc:`getting_started` chapter
contains all information to quickly create an REST API with PSX. The 
:doc:`design` chapter contains more technical details about the anatomy of PSX. 
The last chapter :doc:`concept` covers various concepts to get a deeper 
understanding of PSX.
